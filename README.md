# The Customer Bureau Backend Developer Coding Test (PHP Gacela)

## Instructions

The challenge is to create your own module for this Gacela setup. Gacela is a Class Resolver that works in a similar way to the Spryker internal API.

Your module must:
- Use the Gacela Framework API for your design pattern
- Use and call and external API, such as a weather API, currency converter, or even the Star Wars API‚Ä¶! <a href="https://developer.vonage.com/blog/21/03/15/the-ultimate-list-of-fun-apis-for-your-next-coding-project" target="_blank">Use whatever you want</a>,
but please show that you understand external API calls.
- Present some data on the index screen. Present this whatever way you wish ‚Äì no frontend skills are being tested here! üòä
- Demonstrate that you‚Äôve read the Gacela docs and understand what Gacela is doing and why
